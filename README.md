## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed (for the Python script).
- A modern web browser (for the web interface).
- Basic knowledge of Python and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codeforces-api-fetching-tool.git
   cd codeforces-api-fetching-tool
   ```

2. Install any necessary Python packages (if using the Python script):

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Usage

### Python Script

To fetch data using the Python script:

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python fetch_codeforces_data.py
   ```

2. The script will output data directly to the console. You can modify the script to save the data to a file or process it further as needed.

### Web Interface

To use the web interface:

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. The webpage will automatically fetch data from the Codeforces API and display it in an organized format.
3. Explore the features by interacting with the buttons and dropdowns to view different datasets.
